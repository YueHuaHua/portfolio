				<p>
					Hello, I'm Arum Gunawan, and I'm a front-end and web developer with a background in electrical engineering.  
					During my study, I did some voluntary work as a graphic designer 
					and after several years of working in the engineering field, 
					I realized that my true passion lay in front-end and web development where I can express my creativity while also utilizing my technical skills. 
					So, I decided to switch careers.
				</p>

				<p>
					As a front-end and web developer, I‚Äôm happy to help people to deliver their message effectively through their apps or website 
					whilst also helping the users to navigate the apps effectively. 
					I understand the frustration that can come with trying to navigate a new app or website, 
					especially for those who are not familiar with technologies. 
					I believe that technology should be accessible to everyone, regardless of their level of experience. 
					That's why I'm dedicated to making sure that the apps and websites I work on are user-friendly and accessible to all.
				</p>

				<p>
					In my free time, I love to learn and try something new, do some photography, and spend time with my dog!üê∂‚öæÔ∏è  
					I believe in the importance of work-life balance, and I strive to maintain a healthy and fulfilling lifestyle.
				</p>

				<p>
					So, whether you have a question or not, feel free to contact me!
